        <p>ASD 2019 welcomes submissions in all areas of autonomous systems design, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Design for autonomous systems</b> including processes, modeling, optimization, verification,
                validation,
                and
                test.</li>
            <li>Embedded and cyber-physical <b>systems platforms</b> that implement and execute the autonomous system
                functions
                including their architectures, hardware, software and communication.</li>
            <li><b>Dependable systems design</b> for autonomous systems including, but not limited to, functional
                safety
                concepts,
                fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and
                secure
                changes
                and updates, autonomous systems security.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To emphasize the workshop character, position papers and problem statements elaborating challenges in the
            design
            practice are welcome.
