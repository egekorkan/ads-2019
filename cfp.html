        <p>ASD 2020 welcomes submissions in all areas of autonomous systems design, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system functions
                including aspects related to their architectures, hardware, software and communication,</li>
            <li>the design of autonomous systems including processes, modeling, optimization, verification, validation,
                and test,</li>
            <li>all aspects of dependability in autonomous systems design including, but not limited to, functional
                safety concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine
                learning, safe and secure adaptions and updates, autonomous systems security,</li>
            <li>case studies of autonomous systems design using innovative architectures, methods and tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <p>To emphasize the workshop character, position papers and problem statements elaborating challenges in the design practice are welcome.
            All accepted papers will be published in Dagstuhlâ€™s OpenAccess Series in Informatics (<a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics">OASIcs</a>)
