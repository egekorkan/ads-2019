If you are interested by attending the event, you are welcome to register on the following link (Workshop W03): <a href="https://regonline.react-profile.org/DATE19/Registration/en/start/page_5bb7442668269">Registration page</a>
<br>
<br>

<b>Advanced registration rate:</b> until 13 Feb 2019
<br>
<br>
<b>Important note:</b> If you have already planned to attend the DATE conference, please note that the registration to the conference is decoupled from the registration to the ASD workshop. Therefore, your registration to the conference is not enough to attend the workshop. Alternatively, if you are not planning to attend the DATE conference, then you can register solely to the workshop.
