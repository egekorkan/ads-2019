  speakerName: "Pascal Traverse"
  speakerTitle: "General Manager for the Autonomy Thrust"
  speakerCompany: "Airbus"
  speakerBio: "Pascal is General Manager for the Autonomy Thrust at Airbus. A “thrust” represents a top technical focus area for Airbus. The General Manager creates a vision, coordinates R&T activities with the objective to accelerate the increase of knowledge in Airbus. Before his nomination last year, Pascal was coordinating Airbus Commercial R&T activities related to the cockpit and flight operations. Earlier in his carrier, Pascal participated in the A320/A330/A340/A380 Fly-by-Wire developments, certification harmonization with FAA and EASA, management of Airbus safety activities and even of qualities activities in the A380 Final Assembly Line. Pascal has Master and Doctorate’s degrees in embedded systems from N7 and conducted research in LAAS and UCLA."
  talkAbstract: "Autonomy is in the air: on one hand, pilot shortage is looming; on another hand technologies are maturing, pulled by the automotive market. In this context, Airbus is building a concept airplane from a blank sheet with the objective to improve human-machine teaming for better overall performance. Foundation of this new concept is that when they are made aware of the “big picture” with enough time to analyze it, humans are still the best to make strategic decisions. Autonomy technologies are the main enabler of this concept. Benefit are expected both in a two-crew cockpit and eventually in Single Pilot Operations."
