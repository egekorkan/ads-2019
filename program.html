        <b>Summary:</b> In recent years, various publications and presentations from a lot of companies have shown the
        improvements in the sector of automated driving. The vehicle- and mobility-concept SEDRIC is a current example
        from the Volkswagen AG. However, for a release of these technologies there are several unresolved issues
        regarding sensor technologies,redundancies as well as verification and validation questions. Regarding sensors,
        the main objectives are miniaturization and reduction of system costs. Advantages and disadvantages of existing
        solutions have to be evaluated. In addition to economic aspects ensuring the redundancy of the system is
        absolute necessary. Is, for example,
        Artificial Intelligence able to provide an independent second or third function path? Regarding verification
        and validation concepts, current discussions are focused on which scenarios have to be tested and how, in order
        to enable regulatory authorities to approve the release of automated driving functions? It is conceivable, that
        this is an automotive industry wide task that can only be solved in cooperation with all stakeholders.

        <b>Biography:</b> Born in 1959, Thomas Form studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Braunschweig,
        Germany, joined the Institute for Communication Engineering as research fellow in 1987 and received his Ph.D.
        in 1992. Up to
        2002 he worked as a senior engineer in the Centre for Electromagnetic Compatibility of Volkswagen AG. In 2002
        Dr. Form was appointed as the head of Telephone-/Telematics and Antenna systems development. He became a
        professor for "Electronic Vehicle Systems" in the Institute of Control Engineering at the Technical University
        Braunschweig in 2005 and participated with the CAROLO-Team in the finals of the DARPA URBAN Challenge 2007.
        From 2007 to 2009 he was responsible for concept development, module- and project management in the VW
        Electric/Electronic development. In 2009 he was appointed as head of the "Electronics and Vehicle Research"
        within Volkswagen Group research. Major
        achievements were the presentation of AUDI "Jack" vehicle driving in L3 automatic mode with Journalists from
        San Francisco to CES 2015 in
        Las Vegas and the presentation of the autonomous driving pod "SEDRIC" in 2017. Since 2016 he is the coordinator
        of the German national funded project PEGASUS which wants to answer the question "L3 Highway Chauffeur - how
        safe is safe
        enough and how to prove it". He got the Uni-DAS e.V. ADAS Award for significant influence on the development
        and introduction of driver assistance systems in 2017.

        <b>Summary:</b> The vast researches related to autonomous driving seem steadily progressing - it no longer
        makes news to just have some research vehicle drive autonomously. However, bringing this technology to the
        market, with all the
        associated legal, societal, and ethical responsibilities, with justifiable cost efficiency, is hard at its
        best, and impossible at its worst. Furthermore, the automotive industry is facing drastic challenges in
        electric vehicles, connected
        services, which also heavily impact the whole vehicle architecture.
        AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is a worldwide development partnership of automotive interested
        parties.
        One of its latest challenges is to develop the software platform specification for the highly automated and
        autonomous driving, named AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform. This talk gives an overview of the challenges of such a
        platform, followed by
        the solution approach of AUTOSAR reflecting the industrial needs, and the overall architecture of AUTOSAR
        Adaptive. It also introduces a new multi-kernel OS technology the author develops, describing why such OS
        architecture is
        essential for coping with the challenge in the long run.
