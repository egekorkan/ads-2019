<h6>Welcome to ASD 2019, co-located with DATE 2019</h6>

<p>ASD is the 1st international workshop on Autonomous Systems Design. The goal of ASD is to explore recent industrial and academic methods and methodologies in autonomous systems design. 
    This includes several areas:</p>

        <ul>
<li>Embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system functions including
    their architectures, hardware, software and communication.</li>
<li>The design for autonomous systems including processes, modelling, optimization, verification, validation, and test.</li>
<li>All aspects of dependable systems design for autonomous systems including, but not limited to, functional safety
    concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and
    secure
    changes and updates, autonomous systems security.</li>
        </ul>

The workshop will consist of regular sessions with papers selected from an open call for papers, complemented by
invited sessions on hot topics. Accepted papers will be published as open access in the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics">OASIcs</a>
proceedings in collaboration
with Schloss Dagstuhl â€“ Leibniz Center for Informatics.
