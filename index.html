        The DATE initiative on Autonomous Systems Design (ASD) is a two-day special event at
        DATE, the leading European conference on embedded hardware and software design. 
        It focuses on recent trends and emerging challenges in the field of autonomous systems. 
        Such systems are becoming more and more integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications. 
        Automated driving constitutes today one of the best examples of this trend, in addition to other application domains such as avionics and robotics.

        ASD is organized as a Thursday <i>Initiative</i> day and Friday <i>Workshop</i> day to constitute a two-day continuous program covering different industrial and academic methods and methodologies in the design, verification and validation of autonomous systems. 
        The main areas of interest include but are not limited to the following:


        <ul>
            <li>embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system functions including aspects related to their architectures, hardware, software and communication,</li>
            <li>the design of autonomous systems including processes, modeling, optimization, verification, validation, and test,</li>
            <li>all aspects of dependability in autonomous systems design including, but not limited to, functional safety concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and secure adaptions and updates, autonomous systems security,</li>
            <li>case studies of autonomous systems design using innovative architectures, methods and tools.</li>
        </ul>
        
 <br> </br>

        <h6>Thursday Initiative Day</h6>
        The initiative day on Thursday consists of regular sessions discussing novel technical contributions, hot topics and emerging challenges in the field of autonomous systems. Submitted papers will undergo a peer review process and accepted papers will appear in the DATE conference proceedings.

 <br> </br>

        <h6>Friday Workshop Day</h6>
        The workshop day consists of interactive and working sessions involving methodologies, application kernels and models, software tools and industrial challenges.

<!-- <h6><b>Keynotes</b></h6>

        This year, the workshop will have two distinguished industrial keynotes highlighting
        important challenges and recent trends in the fields of autonomous design. In his
        keynote "Challenges of Automated and Connected Driving", Thomas Form, Head of
        Electronics and Vehicle Research at Volkswagen AG, will talk about the challenges in
        automated driving regarding sensor technologies, redundancies as well as verification
        and validation questions. Masaki Gondo, CTO at eSOL, the company that provides
        POSIX/AUTOSAR/TRON RTOS will talk about AUTOSAR Adaptive as a standardized software
        platform specification for the highly automated and autonomous driving and emphasize
        the role of OS architectures in coping with recent challenges in the field.

<!-- <h6><b>Exhibition & Interactive Discussion</b></h6>


        An exhibition area will include interactive presentations with posters during which all presented papers are
        discussed with the authors. The exhibition area will also involve the following demonstrators,

        <ul>
            <li>Autonomous robots exploring an unknown area using a run-time update to a state of the art environment
                perception and trajectory planning system used in the research vehicle MOBILE. The demonstrator aims at
showing the applicability of the concepts developed in the <a href="http://ccc-project.org/">CCC project</a> to the
                domain of automated driving.
            </li>
            <li>Autonomous racing competitions where small cars explore a track concurrently with other cars and use
                perception, planning and control in order to avoid crashing and complete the track. This demonstrator
is part of the <a href="https://www.date-conference.com/conference/fringe-meeting-fm03-0">F1/10 International
    Autonomous Racing Competition </a>. It will be presented by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy and is supported by IEEE CEDA.
            </li>
        </ul>

       <br>
        The exhibition area will be available to all attendees of the workshop.
