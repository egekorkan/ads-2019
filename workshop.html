        <p class="lead">Call For Papers (<a href="assets/DATE2020_Workshop_CFP.pdf">PDF</a>)</p>

        <p>The goal of the workshop is to explore recent industrial and academic methods and methodologies in autonomous systems design. We invite interested contributors to submit papers to the workshop related, but not limited to, the following areas:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Design for autonomous systems including processes, modeling, optimization, verification, validation, and test.</li>
            <li>Embedded and cyber-physical systems platforms that implement and execute the autonomous system functions including their architectures, hardware, software, and communication.</li>
            <li>Dependable systems design for autonomous systems including, but not limited to, functional safety concepts, fail-operational systems design, functional safety for applications with machine learning, safe and secure changes and updates, autonomous systems security.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To emphasize the workshop character, position papers and problem statements elaborating challenges in the design practice are welcome. We want to specifically introduce an ”Industrial Challenges” session and also ask for problem demos from industry to be presented in ASD. ”Demo Papers” as well as ”Industrial Practice Papers” of 2-4 pages are hence welcome.
